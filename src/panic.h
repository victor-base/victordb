 * libvictor is a public library and exposes well-defined return codes
 * for all user-facing functions.
 *
 * However, any internal inconsistency (e.g., invalid heap pointers,
 * broken invariants, corrupted memory) is treated as a fatal bug
 * in the library itself.
 *
 * In such cases, the system is no longer trustworthy and we prefer
 * to panic early and clearly rather than risk silent corruption.
 *
 * This is intentional and by design.
